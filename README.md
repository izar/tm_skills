# Agent skills to help with Continuous Threat Modeling

## Overview

These are agentic skills aimed at helping developers and security practitioners embody the methodology described in [Continuous Threat Modeling](https://github.com/izar/continuous-threat-modeling).

The skills available here try to follow the best practices described at [Agent Skills](https://skill.md) and shoulg be agnostic as to which agent they work with. YMMV, adjustments in path and location may be necessary. They have been tested with Anthropic's Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. 

The directory "examples" contain pre-generated threat models using different agents and models for the sake of comparison. These are not human-refined threat models.

## Skills Available

pytm - invoke with either /pytm or "threat model this codebase with pytm". 

## Installation

Please refer to your agent's documentation for how to install these skills, as each one's paths vary.
